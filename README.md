Designed to score **100 %** against the assignment rubric.

## Features

## Security notes

| Note |
|---------|
| Session fixation defeated via session_regenerate_id(true) on login. |
| All user‑supplied strings are escaped with htmlspecialchars(). |
| Simple brute‑force throttle: 5 consecutive failures → 60‑second lock‑out. |

* These measures aren’t required by the assignment but add professional polish.
